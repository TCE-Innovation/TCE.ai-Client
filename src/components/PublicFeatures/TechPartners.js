                  Airtable assists various user groups and their specific needs, including TCIG, Estimating, Safety, Engineers, and Project Managers. TCIG and Estimating leverage Airtable's static database functionality to track internal assets and plan future bids, complementing their workflow with Bridgit Bench. The efficiency gains are further enhanced through Airtable's process logic and email automation, seamlessly integrated into multiple applications. The safety team benefits from automation in capturing track/safety certifications in a database and notifies safety managers of expiration dates, reducing downtime required for updating certifications which often have lead times of over three months. Engineers rely on the in-house RFP Ripper, utilizing the Airtable API, to extract vital information from extensive RFP documents, saving valuable time and minimizing key-information from being glossed over. Moreover, Airtable automation facilitates Engineers and Project Managers in tracking GO Requests with the MTA, simplifying a once labor-intensive process of updating and maintaining information as it evolves.
