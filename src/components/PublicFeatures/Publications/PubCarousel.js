The proposed solution, AirTable, will help TC leaders unlock value through transparency, real-time editing and sharing, leading to smarter allocation and scheduling capability. After framing the problem and providing background, later sections will go into detail about the new solution, including some screenshots of the platform and an explanation of the data structures used. Finally, this document ends with a look to the future, how the solution can grow with our organization to address future challenges.",
