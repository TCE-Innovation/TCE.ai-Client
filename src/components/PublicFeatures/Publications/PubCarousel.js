The proposed solution, AirTable, will help TC leaders unlock value through transparency, real-time editing and sharing, leading to smarter allocation and scheduling capability. After framing the problem and providing background, later sections will go into detail about the new solution, including some screenshots of the platform and an explanation of the data structures used. Finally, this document ends with a look to the future, how the solution can grow with our organization to address future challenges.",

OpenSpace allows project teams to share information that previously could only be visualized and understood by traveling to the jobsite. For TCE project teams working on geographically dispersed projects, OpenSpace represents an opportunity to enhance visibility and empower teamwork without the hassle of travel. Besides introducing OpenSpace, this document will outline key use cases identified by TCIG.",
